Visualization codes from the 2nd "speeding up science workshop". This repository contains codes to plot and calculate correlation (linear regression) between metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing results acquired from the same sample.

There is an example of visualizing gene abundances (DNA) compared to their expression levels (RNA) included in the binder. The data are from one Mediterranean site from the TARA Oceans project (https://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6237/1261359.long). The metagenomics come from sample accession SAMEA2619782, and the metatransciptomics come from SAMEA2619784.

## Quick Start
- Click the jupyter notebook file (Correlation_dna_rna.ipynb) to enter the interactive user interface
- You can either run the notebook with the example or upload new files
